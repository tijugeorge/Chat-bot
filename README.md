# Contextual Chatbots with Tensorflow

We’re going to create a chat-bot framework and build a conversational model for an island moped rental shop. The chatbot for this small business needs to handle simple questions about hours of operation, reservation options and so on. We also want it to handle contextual responses such as inquiries about same-day rentals. Getting this right could save a vacation!

__We’ll be working through 3 steps:__
* We’ll transform conversational intent definitions to a Tensorflow model
* Next, we will build a chat-bot framework to process responses
* Lastly, we’ll show how basic context can be incorporated into our response processor
